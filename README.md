### SoftDev

This section documents my activity journey in schoolwork at Southern Luzon State University (SLSU), showcasing the HTML-based projects I developed as part of my academic coursework. These activities were created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, JavaScript for interactivity, and Bootstrap for responsive design. Throughout this journey, I gradually enhanced my front-end development skills, applied classroom concepts to hands-on projects, and improved my ability to build organized, functional, and user-centered web interfaces. These works reflect my continuous learning process and growth in web development during my studies at SLSU.
